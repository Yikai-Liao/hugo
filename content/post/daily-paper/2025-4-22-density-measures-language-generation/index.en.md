## Problem Background

Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating fluent text but struggle with balancing **breadth** (diversity of generated content across the target language) and **validity** (ensuring generated content belongs to the target language). The Kleinberg-Mullainathan (KM) algorithm achieves **generation in the limit**—where generated strings eventually belong to the target language ($K$)—but often produces outputs with density approaching zero in ($K$), limiting diversity. This resembles "mode collapse" (overly similar outputs) and "hallucination" (invalid outputs) in LLMs. This paper introduces **density measures** to quantify this trade-off and proposes an optimized algorithm to address it.

## Proposed Method: Density Measures and Optimized Algorithm

### Density Measures

- **Definition**: For a target language ($K$) ordered as ( $\{\ell_1, \ell_2, \ldots\}$ ) and an algorithm's output set ($O$):
  - **Upper density**: $$\mu_{\text{up}}(O, K) = \limsup_{N \to \infty} \frac{|O \cap \{\ell_1, \ldots, \ell_N\}|}{N}$$
  - **Lower density**: $$\mu_{\text{low}}(O, K) = \liminf_{N \to \infty} \frac{|O \cap \{\ell_1, \ldots, \ell_N\}|}{N}$$
- **Purpose**: These measure the proportion of ($K$) covered by ($O$), with lower density ensuring a minimum breadth.

### Theoretical Framework

- **KM Model**: An adversarial game where an algorithm generates strings based on observed strings ($S_t = \{w_1, \ldots, w_t\}$) from an unknown ($K$), aiming for generation in the limit.
- **KM Limitation**: Its nested chain approach results in zero-density outputs, reducing diversity.

### New Algorithm

- **Goal**: Achieve generation in the limit with $\mu_{\text{low}}(O, K) \geq \frac{1}{8}$.
- **Mechanisms**:
  - **Dynamic Adjustment**: Flexibly selects languages based on ($S_t$).
  - **Fallback Mechanism**: Switches to larger languages when needed.
  - **Token System**: Allocates tokens to control output frequency.
  - **Tree Structure**: Uses a dynamic forest to organize and navigate languages.

## Key Questions and Results

- **Can positive lower density be achieved?** Yes, the new algorithm ensures $\mu_{\text{low}}(O, K) \geq \frac{1}{8}$.
- **Is zero density inevitable?** No, the algorithm counters this.
- **Index-based generation**: Density oscillates but avoids consistently approaching zero.

## Experimental Results (Theoretical)

- Guarantees $\mu_{\text{low}}(O, K) \geq \frac{1}{8}$, outperforming the KM algorithm.
- Introduces "infinite perfect towers" to analyze low-density cases.


## Summary

This paper quantifies the breadth-validity trade-off using density measures and presents an algorithm that ensures a lower density of at least $\frac{1}{8}$, enhancing diversity and validity in language generation.
